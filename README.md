# Blogging Platform Frontend

This is the frontend of the **Blogging Platform**, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The project is structured to deliver a seamless user interface flow that includes login, signup, and blog management features. The app is powered by **Next.js** and includes validation, navigation, and all the necessary components for an interactive user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development server, run:

`npm run dev`

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

You can start editing the app's pages by modifying the respective components under the `app` directory. Changes will auto-update as you edit the files.

## UI Flow

This project includes the following pages for the user interface flow:

- **Login Page** – A simple page for users to log in to their accounts.
- **Signup Page** – Allows users to create a new account.
- **Dashboard** – Displays a list of blogs and provides navigation to other sections.
- **My Blog Page** – Allows users to view, edit, and delete their own blog posts.
- **View Page** – A detailed view of a single blog post.
- **Create/Edit Blog Page** – Lets users create or edit a blog post.

The app utilizes the **app router** to manage the navigation between these pages. Validation is included to ensure user input is correct, and the header provides easy navigation to key pages.

## Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) – React framework for production.
- **App Router** – Used for clean and organized routing.
- **Validation** – Ensures the input is validated on all forms.
